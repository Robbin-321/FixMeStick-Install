This article tells you how to install FixMeStick, including what you need to do to get started, what your system needs, and how to fix problems that come up.

What Sets FixMeStick Apart?
FixMeStick is meant to be a malware cleanup tool that you can plug in and use right away. FixMeStick doesn't install software directly on your computer. Instead, it uses a bootable USB drive to start its own operating system. This lets it get beyond any threats or blocks that infected computers make. It's great at getting rid of infections, spyware, trojans, and ransomware that normal antivirus software typically misses.

Requirements for Installing the System

Make sure your machine fulfills the minimal requirements before you start the installation process:

Windows 7 or later and macOS 10.8 or later are the operating systems that work.

USB Port: There must be at least one open port (USB 2.0 or 3.0)

Internet Access: Recommended for updates and activation

BIOS Access: Required if you need to boot from USB manually

Processor speed: 1 GHz or faster

RAM: At least 512 MB (1 GB is better)

These criteria make sure that FixMeStick scans work easily and successfully.

Problems with booting and fixing them

FixMeStick is supposed to start up immediately after the restart, but certain users may have problems because of BIOS or system settings. This is how to fix common difficulties that happen when you start up:

Secure Boot is on

Some modern PCs have "Secure Boot" turned on in the BIOS, which could stop FixMeStick from starting up.

If you need to, go to your BIOS settings and turn off Secure Boot.

Incorrect Order of Boot

Make sure that USB is set as the boot drive on your PC.

To choose the USB drive manually, use the boot menu, which usually appears when you start up your computer.

Not booting older systems

If you have an old machine, try utilizing a USB 2.0 port instead of a USB 3.0 connector.

Visit the manufacturer's website to see if there are any firmware upgrades or compatibility notices.

How to Install FixMeStick Successfully

Make sure you have a stable internet connection the first time you run it to make sure updates are installed.

Wait until the scan is done before taking out the USB stick.

To avoid problems with file access, close all programs before starting FixMeStick.

FixMeStick doesn't delete personal data, however you should back up crucial files first.

Carefully follow the instructions on the screen, especially when you restart and scan.

What Happens After You Install It?

After it is installed and turned on:

FixMeStick will start your computer in a safe, secure place.

The scan will start on its own and look for viruses, malware, and other files that don't seem right.

Depending on what the user wants, any threats discovered will be put in quarantine or deleted.

At the end, there will be a summary of the scan with choices to view or print the report.

You can now unplug FixMeStick and start your computer back up in the normal way.

Using FixMeStick again

You can use FixMeStick as many times as your membership lets you. To get the best results:

Run it once a month or whenever your computer acts strangely.

Make sure it has the most recent virus definitions.

To keep it from getting damaged, store it safely when you're not using it.
